##Chess - Part 2

###Procedure 1 

(IL) Create a structure called Piece that contains name, color, where

name is for the name of the piece, and color is Black or White. The array board now is

of the type Piece.    



###Procedure 2

(IL) Update the function showBoard in order to show both the pieces

and their colors.

Create a function called setBoard which sets the board to the starting board.

Show the starting board.



###Procedure 3 

Allow the user to choose a square. Check if the square is empty. If it

is, let the user choose again. If it has a piece, let the user choose another square and

do legal move verification. Note that the verification is substantially more complicated

than before. Output the result of the verification as Yes or No.

For in lab, do this for a rook.

###Procedure 4

If a legal move verification is a good one, move the piece to the new

square. Show the new board.

###Procedure 5

Starting with the starting board, repeat the process of choosing and

moving a piece. Keep track of whether it is a Black’s move or a White’s move.
